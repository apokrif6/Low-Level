**Model of computation** is a set of basic operations and their respective costs.
The costs are usually integer numbers and are used to reason about the algorithms’ complexity via
calculating the combined cost of all their operations. We are not going to discuss computational complexity
in this book.
Most models of computation are also **abstract machines**. It means that they describe a hypothetical
computer, whose instructions correspond to the model’s basic operations. The other type of models,
decision trees, is beyond the scope of this book.
